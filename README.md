this project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python in Google Colab. The dataset is first uploaded and cleaned by removing any missing values. 
Various visualizations, including graphs, are generated to explore patterns and trends in the data.
Additionally, correlation analysis is conducted to understand relationships between variables, providing deeper insights into the dataset.
This comprehensive analysis helps uncover hidden structures, trends, and potential areas for further investigation.
